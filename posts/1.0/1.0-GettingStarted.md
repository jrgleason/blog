# Building a Node Application

## Introduction

The goal of this post is to provide a simple example for using Node to create a Koa based Web Application.

### Why Node?

I tend to like Node because I like Javascript. The fact provides a bunch of advantages including being able to utilize the same skill-set as the front end frameworks we all use. 

### Why Koa?

There are 2 main Node web frameworks. The more popular Express and the focus of this post Koa. Both projects we started by [T.J. Holowaychuk](https://github.com/tj) and even he has moved on to serverless and Go. However, I tend to like Koa and Express for getting a project together, then converting it over to something more performance oriented.

### Why not Golang?

## Getting started

    npm install
